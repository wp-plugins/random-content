Randomly display any content anywhere on your site.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to display random content anywhere on your site using a shortcode or widget. You can group your random content together, allowing you to display different content in multiple locations throughout your site.

The content is added via a custom post type, so you have full access to the tinyMCE editor. This allows you to easily add images, text, and links to your random content. 

= Using a widget =
1. Navigate to Appearance->Widgets and add the Random Content widget to a sidebar.
2. Select a group from the dropdown. If you don't create a group, the widget will use all entries.

= Using a shortcode =
Place the shortcode `[random_content]` anywhere on a post or page. 

To choose entries from a specific group, add the `group_id` parameter. For example, `[random_content group_id="64"]`. 

To specify the number of posts to show, add the `num_posts` parameter. For example, `[random_content group_id="13" num_posts="3"]`. 


 
== Installation ==

1. Upload `random-content.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create an entry in the Random Content post type. 
4. Categorize your content using Groups.

**Only content within the content editor will be displayed.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I group certain entries together? =

Yes. Create a group, and assign specific entries to the group. It works just like categories. 

= How do I find the group id? =

Click on Random Content > Group in the WordPress admin. Look for the number in the ID column.

= How do I display more than one post? =

In the shortcode, use the num_posts parameter. In the widget, enter a number in the "Number of Posts to Show at Once" input.

== Screenshots ==

1. Adding the widget to a sidebar.
