Randomly display content from a custom post type.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to display random content anywhere on your site using a widget. You can group your content together so you can display multiple widgets with different content. 

The content is added via a custom post type, so you have full access to the tinyMCE editor. This allows you to easily add images, text, and links to your random content. 
 
== Installation ==

1. Upload `random-content.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create an entry in the Random Content post type. 
4. Navigate to Appearance->Widgets and add the Random Content widget to a sidebar.

If you want to organize your content, create a group. If you don't create a group, the widget will use all entries.

**Only content within the content editor will be displayed in the widget.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I assign entries to a certain widget? =

Yes. Create a group, assign specific entries to the group, and choose the group in the widget settings.
